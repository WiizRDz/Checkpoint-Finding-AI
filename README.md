# Checkpoint-Finding-AI
Genetic AI path finding algorithm and visualizer

Simple genetic path seeking algorithm coded in JavaScript paired with HTML5 Canvas visualizer. The dots are trying to follow the path set by the three checkpoints on screen in a clockwise direction. Each generation tries to improve from the previous as the inital random movements of the dots are naturally selected to optimize the movement path of the dots. 

Serves as an introduction to Genetic Learning Algorithms, clearly showing the progress by displaying each generation and allowing user to see the progress along with the max fitness of the current generation. Algorithm adapted from https://git.io/fxZhB.
